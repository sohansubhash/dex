76,9,"It is said to live in volcanic craters on mountain peaks. Once a year, it sheds its hide and grows larger. The shed hide crumbles and returns to the soil."
76,10,It is enclosed in a hard shell that is as rugged as slabs of rock. It sheds skin once a year to grow larger.

76,27,"Its body can survive dynamite blasts without a single scratch, but it hates rain and humidity."
76,28,"Once a year, this Pokémon molts, and its shed shell returns to the soil. This process creates enriched soil, so farmers collect the shells."
76,29,"When Golem grow old, they stop shedding their shells. Those that have lived a long, long time have shells green with moss."
76,30,It detonates its own body. The power from that explosion can propel it up steep mountain paths with amazing speed.
76,31,"Once it sheds its skin, its body turns tender and whitish. Its hide hardens when it’s exposed to air."

80,1,The SHELLDER that is latched onto SLOWPOKE's tailis said to feed on the host's left over scraps.
80,3,"Lives lazily by the sea. If the SHELLDER on itstail comes off, it becomes a SLOWPOKE again."
80,4,"If the tail-biting SHELLDER is thrown off in a harshbattle, it reverts to being an ordi­ nary SLOWPOKE."
80,5,"Naturally dull to begin with, it lost its abilityto feel pain due to SHELLDER's seeping poison."
80,6,An attached SHELLDER won't let go because of thetasty flavor that oozes out of its tail.
80,7,"SLOWBRO’s tail has a SHELLDER firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can’t be used for fishing anymore.This causes SLOWBRO to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead."
80,9,"Its tail has a SHELLDER firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can’t be used for fishing anymore. This forces it to reluctantly swim and catch prey."
80,10,"When a SLOWPOKE went hunting in the sea, its tail was bitten by a SHELLDER. That made it evolve into SLOWBRO."

80,28,"Whenever Shellder bites down hard on its tail, it gives Slowbro a flash of inspiration...which it forgets a moment later."
80,29,"Spacing out is basically all it does. It turns back into Slowpoke if its tail, along with Shellder, breaks off."
80,30,"Shellder, in its greed to suck out more and more sweetness from Slowbro’s tail, has metamorphosed into a spiral-shaped shell."
80,31,"Lives lazily by the sea. If the Shellder on its tail comes off, it becomes a Slowpoke again."
80,33,Slowpoke became Slowbro when a Shellder bit on to its tail. Sweet flavors seeping from the tail make the Shellder feel as if its life is a dream.
80,34,"Being bitten by a Shellder shocked this Pokémon into standing on two legs. If the Shellder lets go, it seems Slowbro will turn back into a Slowpoke."

81,29,"It’s frequently the cause of power outages, which is why some power plants send out electrical signals that it can’t stand."
81,30,"Perhaps because electrical lines are often buried these days, the number of Magnemite attacks on power plants has increased."
81,31,It is hatched with the ability to defy gravity. It floats while emitting powerful electromagnetic waves.
81,33,"At times, Magnemite runs out of electricity and ends up on the ground. If you give batteries to a grounded Magnemite, it’ll start moving again."

83,33,"The stalk this Pokémon carries in its wings serves as a sword to cut down opponents. In a dire situation, the stalk can also serve as food."
83,34,"They use a plant stalk as a weapon, but not all of them use it in the same way. Several distinct styles of stalk fighting have been observed."
84,1,A bird that makes up for its poor flying with itsfast foot speed. Leaves giant footprints.
